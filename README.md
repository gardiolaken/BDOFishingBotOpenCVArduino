#This program does not have best practice!!!
#Purpose of this program is for interest and pleasure.
#This was done rushed and with a 'just make it work' approach.

# In summary, this program reads the screen to get a sequence of letters, 
# then 'type' that sequence on a keyboard using a bunch of Servo Motor to emulate a human typing.
# This is all done using an Arduino.

# HARDWARE
# Servo Motors on Amazon - SG90 9G Micro Servo Motor: Smraza 10PCS Mini Servos Metal Gear for RC Robot/Car/Plane Micro Servos with Cable for Arduino Kit
# Arduino Kit on Amazon - ELEGOO UNO Project Super Starter Kit with Tutorial, 5V Relay, UNO R3, Power Supply Module, Servo Motor, 9V Battery with DC, Prototype Expansion Board, ect. for Arduino


#The game is called "BlackDesertOnline" that is on a private server. (not retail).
#This is done for fun. I dont play anymore.
#The game has a fishing game where there would be a pop up when fishing that would contain a sequence of letters.
#The user has then to type it in the correct order.
#When successful, the user would successfully catch the fish.
#A filter is also added when only specific fish are stored. Others are skipped.
